# Staking Pool Mishaps
## Objective
I aim to have this document serve as an up-to-date register of every slashing event & rugpull that occurs across the various staking pools taking place on the Ethereum network. 

The intent is to update this document on a weekly basis (minimum), at least until I am able to finish the script to automate the process. Crypto is only a part-time job for me right now so my time to work on this & other projects is limited.

If you have any questions for me or know of any (new or old) rugpulls that I may be missing, please reach out with the contact information below, or submit a pull request.
